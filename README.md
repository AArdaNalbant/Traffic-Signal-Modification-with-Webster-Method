# Traffic Light Management System

This is a program that simulates a traffic flow. The signal durations are optimized through a new method that we tried.

## Usage

"runner.py" can be run to simulate the traffic flow using our approach at handling signal durations. 
"runner_fixed.py" can be run to compare our approach with a standard,fixed-time approach. 

The flows are randomly generated from the map. The map can be changed by modifying the .net.xml file, or by adding a new .net.xml file and referring to it inside the config file.
